### What did you work on this past week?
Sammy: Built a demo buzzer controlled by the Pi. It detects noise with one mic. A simple buzzer motor responds to that information. 
Arturo: Helped Sammy and built a python webserver that uses websockets to communicate sample data to a client.
Scott: Implemented client side code for the watch
Julian: Implemented watch buzzing functionality and experimented with different types and durations of buzz. 

### What will you work on this coming week?
Sammy: Double up on the demo buzzer. One for each side. 
Arturo: Work with Scott to decide what information the watches and server will communicate to each other and build out the corresponding backend.
Scott: Work with Arturo for the communication between watches and server. Work with Julian to ingreate buzzing software and websocket software in the watch. 
Julian: Work with Scott to integrate watch software

### What is in your way or impeding progress?
Thanksgiving, no access to the fancy mics yet,
